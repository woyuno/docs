## Notes

- The VoidChain platform token can retain up to 9 decimal places, so when transferring and managing tokens, you need to add 9 zeros at the end.
- The platform gives each account about 10 free gas fees per day, but this is not automatic. Each account needs to actively execute a daily free energy retrieval once.
- When operating on the platform, each gas fee will be deducted from the gifted pool first. If exhausted, it will automatically purchase one platform coin's worth of gas energy. The current pricing is also about 10 operations. Purchased gas energy will remain valid and will not be cleared to zero, but the gifted energy will be automatically cleared to zero the next day.
